# Tu-lambda meetup planning

Hi! This is the space where we plan our tu-lambda meetups. Right now, you can:

1. suggest new things you want to share:
   1. [talks](https://github.com/tu-lambda/planning/issues/new?template=talk.yml): Normal length (20-45 minutes) with questions afterwards
   2. [lightning talks](https://github.com/tu-lambda/planning/issues/new?template=lightning_talk.yml): Roundabout 5 minutes; several ones go one after another

And maybe more in the future? Open to suggestions! ^^
